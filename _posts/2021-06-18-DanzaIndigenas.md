*Danza Indígenas*, which translates to “Indigenous Dance,” is a public artwork completed in 1993 by artist Judy Baca. Located at the Baldwin Park Metrolink train station, this installation features a “20-foot-high re-creation of an archway from the nearby San Gabriel Mission.” “Etched into the central arch is the word *Sunigna*, the Gabrielino name for the area, and a quote from Latina author Gloria Anzaldúa: ‘This land was Mexican once, was Indian always and is, and will be again.’ Lettering on the plaza floor spells out, in English, the statement: ‘When the Indians died, the villages ended.’”

According to Baca, she created this monument to “‘put memory into a piece of the land’ that once was home to the American Indian cultures.” She also “wanted to portray an ‘authentic’ and ‘truthful’ vision of [Baldwin Park’s] history.”

On May 14th, 2005, Save Our State, a Ventura-based anti-immigrant group, protested the monument and organized to have it removed because of its supposedly anti-American sentiment. That same day, however, hundreds of counter-protesters fought for the preservation of the monument; “Next to City Hall, where about 60 protesters opposed to illegal immigration waved signs and American flags, about 600 counter-protesters sang, danced, chanted and beat drums to urge tolerance.” “The monument was successfully preserved despite two marches by the Anti-immigrant groups and repeated demands for it’s removal.”

Today, the monument still stands and has been presesrved.

“As a lifelong resident of Baldwin Park, I’m very happy to say that the monument still stands today. In fact, it’s one of the first things that I first see when I get off the Metro coming from Union Station and USC. Getting to learn about its history and cultural significance through the Robin Dunitz Archive has been extremely fascinating and fulfilling,” says USC junior Enrique Martinez III.
