*Chagall Returns to Venice Beach* is a mural completed by artist Christina Schlesinger and commissioned by SPARC (which Schlesinger co-founded!) in 1996. Located on the walls of the Israel Levin Center in Venice, CA, this mural honors the “neighborhood’s Jewish heritage” and restores what had been lost to the Northridge earthquake in 1994.

Below is some information about the mural from the SPARC website:

> “The mural employs imagery from the Russian-Jewish painter Marc Chagall superimposed onto the Venice Beachfront. At the far left a rabbi is holding a torah on which is written, in Hebrew, the 5th Commandment, “Honor Thy Father and Thy Mother.” A Chagall bird leaps from the flames and leads the viewer’s eye into the main section of the mural, where various characters and images from Chagall are placed onto the Venice Beach and boardwalk. A rabbi with a small rabbi standing on top of his head, indicates the many generations of teachers in Jewish history. Next to the fiddler on the roof the viewer sees the non-Chagallian character, an angel on roller blades representing contemporary Venice beach. He stands beneath a candelabrum of seven candles, referring to the seven-branched menorah and the extensive use of light in Jewish religion and culture. At the other end of the mural is a poem about overcoming obstacles called “Roots.” It is written by 95-year-old Dora Bayrack.”
