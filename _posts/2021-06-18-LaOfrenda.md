*La Ofrenda*, which translates to ‘The Offering,’ is a mural completed in 1989 by artist Yreina Cervantez. An *ofrenda* is a collection of objects presented in memoriam during Día de los Muertos. This mural depicts Dolores Huerta who was the co-founder of the United Farm Workers of America and a prominent figure in the United Farm Workers Movement. Prior to its restoration in 2016, *La Ofrenda* was completely covered up by tags, but as of December of 2020, the mural has been restored.
