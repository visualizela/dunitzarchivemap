*Love is for Everyone* is a mural by artists Mary-Linn Hughes and Reginald Zachary, created under SPARC’s Neighborhood Pride Program in 1991. According to *Los Angeles Times* staff writer Zan Dubin, “SPARC officials, who have catalogued [over] 10,000 murals worldwide, believe this to be the first that addresses AIDS.”

The text on the mural reads: “I am your co-worker, I am the married couple who live down the street, I am your high school teacher, the woman you sit next to on the bus, the plumber who fixes your sink, the athlete you watch of television, the field worker who harvests your food, I am your brother, your sister, I am a person living with AIDS.” The same text repeats in Spanish. 

When asked about the intent behind the mural’s creation, Hughes said, “We really wanted to represent all the different people who have been affected by AIDS and HIV.” This explains why most of the faces on the mural are featureless; they have no specific identity because they embrace every identity. The silhouetted figures are painted over a  “colorful background ‘quilt,’” which refers to the comfort offered at the Minority AIDS Project (MAP) –– where the mural is located; the mural, illustrating “the clinic’s mission, its function and the people it serves.”

According to Dubin, MAP is a nonprofit organization run by Black and Latinx people "[that] provides free support and assistance for people with AIDS or those infected with HIV, counseling, emergency funding, medical referrals, immigration information, education and other services.”

According to a recent assessment done by SPARC, “the mural has suffered slight delimitation and layers of gray paint on 60% of the mural.”
