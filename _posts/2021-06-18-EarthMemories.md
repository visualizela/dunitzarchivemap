Robin Dunitz once said, "Murals are hidden gems." As part of her involvement with the Mural Conservancy of Los Angeles, Robin organized and led bus tours of murals in Los Angeles, uncovering hidden gems people may not have noticed or given much thought before.

One of the hidden gems on her tour was *Earth Memories*, a 1996 mural completed by artist Eva Cockcroft and sponsored by ARTScorpsLA and the Hollywood Beautification Team. Located at Belmont High School, the mural illustrates the history of evolution, from the Big Bang to the emergence of man, focalized through the regions of North America and California.

For Cockcroft, public art "gives a neighborhood an identity, creates beauty and something for people to see as they walk by.” Given the massive size of the wall, she believed that "nothing less than the history of the universe" would be an appropriate subject. She designed this mural with the intent to create something that “relates to the people in the community, that is something they want and they understand.”

Today, the paint has become slightly chipped and parts of the mural have been tagged. Aside from this, *Earth Memories* has largely been conserved.
